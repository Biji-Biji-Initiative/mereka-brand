Brand Guideline

## Our logos

- The Mereka logo is composed of an octothorpe and a logotype set in Lato.
- The horizontal logo is the primary logo and should be used in the majority of situations.
- The background logo is intended for large-scale use. Avoid using at small sizes, as it can become illegible.
- Always use the logo files provided. Do not re-create.

## Typography: Lato

Typeset all headers and subheaders in Lato.

## Typography: Poppins

Typeset all text and paragraph text in Poppins.

## Internal partnership lockup

The internal partnership lockup is used for communication around approved Mereka internal
partnerships. We lock up the Mereka logo with a partner logo, placing the Mereka logo either
to the left or top of the partner's logo. We add clear space between the logos equal to the size
of the octothorpe, and divide this space in half by a vertical line.

Both logos should feel of equal size. Partner logos should be aligned to the optical baseline of the
Mereka logotype.

Mereka Group (usage for when all Mereka brand are involved).

We also kindly ask that you adhere to the following:
- Do not pair the Mereka octothorpe with partner logos - always use the Mereka logo.
- Do not use the Mereka name or marks as part of your own.
- Do not use Mereka in any advertising without our explicit approval.
- Do not use Mereka assets or similar words or marks on apparel or merchandise.

## Video

- Lower thirds: Design should be clean and clear. Names should be set in Open Sans Bold, titles in Lato
  regular and backgrounds set to 80% opacity.
- Ending slates: All videos should end with the Mereka logo, animated or still.
- Watermarked logos: Watermarked logos should be placed in the upper left at 50% opacity.
