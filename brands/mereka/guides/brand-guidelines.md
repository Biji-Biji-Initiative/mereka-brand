# Mereka Brand Guidelines (Extracted)

This document is a text extraction from `brand-guidelines.pdf` for quick reference.
Use the PDF for visual examples, sizing diagrams, and lockup layouts.

## Logos

- The logo is composed of an octothorpe and a logotype set in Lato.
- The horizontal logo is the primary logo and should be used in most situations.
- The background logo is intended for large-scale use; avoid small sizes where it can become illegible.
- Always use the provided logo files; do not recreate the mark.

## Internal partnership lockup

- Used for approved internal partnerships.
- Lock up the Mereka logo with a partner logo, placing the Mereka logo to the left or top.
- Clear space between logos should equal the size of the octothorpe, divided by a vertical line.
- Both logos should feel equal in size and align to the optical baseline of the logotype.
- "Mereka Group" lockup is used when all Mereka brands are involved.

Do not:
- Pair the octothorpe alone with partner logos.
- Use the Mereka name or marks as part of your own.
- Use Mereka in advertising without explicit approval.
- Use Mereka assets or similar words or marks on apparel or merchandise.

## Video

- Lower thirds: clean design, names in Open Sans Bold, titles in Lato Regular, background at 80% opacity.
- Ending slates: all videos end with the Mereka logo, animated or still.
- Watermarked logos: upper left at 50% opacity.
