## Introduction

### Who we are

The Biji-biji Initiative is an environmentally focused organization founded in June 2013
by a group of eco-conscious individuals. Central to its mission is the cultivation of
changemakers through social and environmental impact accelerator programs. By
facilitating access to education and innovative solutions, Biji-biji seeks to reinforce
the larger sustainability ecosystem.

### Our values

- Articulate intentions through action and innovation: be purposeful in all we do, to drive towards a common good.
- Practice resilience and perseverance: embrace change and challenges with grace and grit.
- Embody humility and authenticity: be kind, real, and true to oneself and one another in any situation.
- Be bold and creative in breaking boundaries: think beyond the norm in problem-solving and reaching greater heights.
- Stand for inclusive and sustainable growth: strive for growth individually and collectively for humanity and the environment.

## Logo usage

### The logo

- The logo must feature prominently in all visual communications and stand alone without amalgamation with other symbols or graphics.
- "Prominently displayed" means positioned on the cover or at the outset of visual communications, with clear space and minimum size for legibility.
- The primary logo is required on all print media, advertising, websites, other media, and external communications.

### The spelling

The brand name is stylized as "Biji-biji Initiative" with only the initial "Biji" capitalized.
"Initiative" is singular and should not include an "s".

Examples from the guide:
- Biji-biji Initiative: correctly spelled.
- Biji-Biji Initiative: only the first "biji" is capitalized.
- Biji-biji Initiatives: "Initiative" is singular.

## Digital content

### Aspect ratio

When editing or creating digital content for social media, follow the most common aspect ratio canvases.

Post and carousel:
- 1:1 at 1080px x 1080px.
- 5:4 at 1350px x 1080px (most recommended).
- 3:2 at 1620px x 1080px (recommended).

Story, reel, and video:
- 1:1 at 1080px x 1080px.
- 4:5 at 1080px x 1350px (recommended).
- 2:3 at 1080px x 1650px.
- 9:16 at 1080px x 1920px (most recommended).

### Negative space

- Posts and carousels: provide enough bleeding space (at least 70px) to improve readability.
- Videos: keep enough negative space so platform navigation bars do not interfere with content.

### Margin and bleed

When designing reading material such as profile and event booklets, use proper margins to give breathing room.
For print materials, include bleed to avoid white strips after trimming.

### Canvas and export

The full definition resolution is 1080p. Social platforms compress content, so use a larger canvas
(usually 2x) and export at standard 1080p sizes.

| Aspect Ratio | Canvas Size (px) | Export Size (px) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1:1 | 2160 x 2160 | 1080 x 1080 |
| 4:5 | 2160 x 2700 | 1080 x 1350 |
| 16:9 | 3840 x 2160 | 1920 x 1080 |
