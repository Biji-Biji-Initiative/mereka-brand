## Who we are

The Biji-biji Initiative is an environmentally focused organization founded in June 2013
by a group of eco-conscious individuals. Central to its mission is the cultivation of
changemakers through social and environmental impact accelerator programs. By
facilitating access to education and innovative solutions, Biji-biji seeks to reinforce
the larger sustainability ecosystem.

## Values

- Articulate intentions through action and innovation: be purposeful in all we do, to drive towards a common good.
- Practice resilience and perseverance: embrace change and challenges with grace and grit.
- Embody humility and authenticity: be kind, real, and true to oneself and one another in any situation.
- Be bold and creative in breaking boundaries: think beyond the norm in problem-solving and reaching greater heights.
- Stand for inclusive and sustainable growth: strive for growth individually and collectively for humanity and the environment.
