## The logo

The Biji-biji logo must feature prominently in all visual communications, standing alone
without amalgamation with other symbols or graphics. "Prominently displayed" denotes
positioning the logo on the cover or at the outset of visual communications, maintaining
clear space for readability, and adhering to the stipulated minimum size to preserve
visibility and impact.

The primary logo is required on all print media (brochures, periodicals, etc.), all advertising,
websites, all other media, and external communications according to appropriate guidelines.

## The spelling

Our brand name is meticulously stylized as "Biji-biji Initiative." Note that only the initial "Biji"
is capitalized, emphasizing the organic and interconnected nature of our innovative
initiatives. Furthermore, "Initiative" is deliberately spelled without an "s," underscoring the
singular focus and commitment embedded in our approach.

Biji-biji Initiative - Correctly spelled
Biji-Biji Initiative - Only first "biji" is capitalized
Biji-biji Initiatives - "Initiative" is singular

## The restrictions

To ensure the consistency and legibility of the logo, there are certain restrictions that
should be applied to the logo.

- Colour scheme: Do not stray from the color palette.
- Elements of logo: Do not rearrange elements of the logo.
- Disproportionate scaling: Do not stretch or distort the logo.
- Logo orientation: Do not change the orientation of the logo.
- Drop shadow: Do not use drop shadows when reproducing the logo.

## The size

The application of the logo must not be less than 15mm in width as it will affect the
legibility of the logo.

Preferred sizes for standard paper formats:
- Smallest size: 15mm
- Name card: 15mm
- A4: >25mm
- A3: >35mm

## The colour

The logo is always displayed in solid black, which was used to ensure visibility on a
variety of surfaces. To guarantee visibility, it is advised against placing the logo on
surfaces with deeper colors.

To preserve the integrity of the logo in a variety of settings, a solid white substitute
color may be utilized in cases when the original black is inappropriate.

Original colour:
- BLACK `#000000`

Alternative colour:
- WHITE `#ffffff`

## The white space

The minimum white space as referred to "x-space" and "y-space" is constant and is to be
maintained when the logo is proportionally enlarged or reduced in size.

## The position

When the logo is used on its own it is always positioned as shown, adhering to isolation
zone rules. In such to ensure optimal readability and recognition of the logo.

Note: Watermark must be added to all photos posted on social media and sent to members
of the public, including press.
